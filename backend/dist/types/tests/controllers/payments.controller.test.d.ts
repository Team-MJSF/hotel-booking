/**
 * Unit Tests for the Payments Controller
 *
 * This file contains comprehensive tests for the payment-related functionality in our API.
 * We test six main controller functions:
 * 1. getAllPayments - Retrieving payment lists
 * 2. getPaymentById - Retrieving a specific payment by ID
 * 3. createPayment - Creating new payments (to be implemented by teammate)
 * 4. updatePayment - Updating existing payments
 * 5. deletePayment - Deleting payments
 * 6. processPayment - Processing payments through external payment system
 *
 * The tests use dependency injection to provide mock implementations of the models
 * and external payment system, making testing cleaner and more maintainable.
