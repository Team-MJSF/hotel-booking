/**
 * Unit Tests for the Rooms Controller
 *
 * This file contains comprehensive tests for the room-related functionality in our API.
 * We test these main controller functions:
 * 1. getAllRooms - Retrieving room lists with various filtering options
 * 2. checkRoomAvailability - Checking room availability for specific date ranges
 * 3. getRoomsByAmenities - Filtering rooms by specific amenities
 * 4. createRoom - Creating new rooms
 * 5. updateRoom - Updating existing rooms
 * 6. deleteRoom - Deleting rooms
 *
 * The tests use dependency injection to provide mock implementations of the models,
 * making testing cleaner and more maintainable.
