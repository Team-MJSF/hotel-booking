/**
 * Unit Tests for the Bookings Controller
 *
 * This file contains comprehensive tests for the booking-related functionality in our API.
 * We test five main controller functions:
 * 1. getAllBookings - Retrieving booking lists
 * 2. getBookingById - Retrieving a specific booking by ID
 * 3. createBooking - Creating new bookings
 * 4. updateBooking - Updating existing bookings
 * 5. deleteBooking - Deleting bookings
 *
 * The tests use dependency injection to provide mock implementations of the models,
 * making testing cleaner and more maintainable.
