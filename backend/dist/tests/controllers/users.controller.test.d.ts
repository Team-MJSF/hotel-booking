/**
 * Unit Tests for the Users Controller
 *
 * This file contains comprehensive tests for the user-related functionality in our API.
 * We test these main controller functions:
 * 1. getAllUsers - Retrieving user lists
 * 2. createUser - Creating new users
 * 3. updateUser - Updating existing users
 * 4. deleteUser - Deleting users
 *
 * The tests use dependency injection to provide mock implementations of the models,
 * making testing cleaner and more maintainable.
